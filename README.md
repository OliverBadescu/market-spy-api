MarketSpy

MarketSpy is a web application that helps users track product prices, compare competitor pricing, and receive real-time notifications when price changes occur. The project consists of a backend built with Java Spring Boot and a frontend developed using React with Vite.

Backend Tasks (Java) 
1. Set up the backend project using Spring Boot. 
2. Design the database schema for storing product details, competitor prices, and user 
preferences. 
3. Create RESTful APIs for: 
o User registration and authentication. 
o Adding/updating products to track. 
o Fetching competitor price data. 
o Managing user notification preferences. 
4. Implement error handling for better debugging and monitoring. 
5. Integrate a web scraping tool (e.g., Jsoup or Selenium) to collect competitor prices. 
6. Implement price comparison logic to analyze prices and identify trends. 
7. Set up a scheduler (e.g., using Spring Scheduler) to periodically fetch and update 
competitor prices. 
8. Implement user authentication using JWT. 
9. Develop a notification system to send alerts via email, SMS, or in-app notifications 
when price changes are detected. 
10. Write unit tests for backend services using JUnit and Mockito. 
11. Optimize database queries for faster retrieval of price data. 
12. Containerize the backend using Docker for easy deployment. 
Frontend Tasks (React) 
14. Set up the React project using Vite. 
15. Design the user interface for: 
 User registration and login. 
 Adding/editing products to track. 
 Displaying price comparison results. 
 Managing notification settings. 
16. Integrate with backend APIs using Axios or Fetch for data fetching and updates. 
17. Implement responsive design using a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Material-UI. 
18. Add charts/graphs (e.g., using Chart.js or Recharts) to visualize price trends over time. 
19. Develop real-time notifications using WebSocket or a library like Socket.IO to notify 
users of price changes instantly.
